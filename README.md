# Introduction
I tested NUMBER_HERE different `Github repo implementations`/`models`/`implementations`/`software` of AI Background Removal. I tried to stick to FOSS sources but NUMBER_HERE of the implementations are not, EXAMPLES_HERE which obviously is not FOSS.

**If you only want to see the results visit:** [results.md]()

note: **the results I present are not definitive, you could perhaps get better results with tweaking the implementation's settings/prompts/parameters etc.**

I tested the following:

# My Recommendations

Some people might come here to just find the best background removal method/model/implementation/software, so I'll provide my recommendations here at the beginning.

Scroll to the bottom or [click here to go to 'My Recommendations' Showcase](#my-recommendations-showcase).

I do invite you though to read the rest of the [README.md](https://github.com/Courage-1984/AI-Background-Removal-Results/blob/main/README.md) as it is quite interesting and informative and you might find something you wanted that is perhaps not here in 'My Recommendations'. Remember 'My Recommendations' is subjective and the testing/evaluations was done on a small dataset and with a basic understanding of the different implementations' *scripts*.

So here are my recommendations: ([Jump to Results](GITHUB_#_LINK_HERE))

1. [NAME_HERE](LINK_HERE)
2. [NAME_HERE](LINK_HERE)
3. [NAME_HERE](LINK_HERE)
4. [NAME_HERE](LINK_HERE)

# Results

## DDColor | [Repo](https://github.com/piddnad/DDColor) | [Model Zoo](https://github.com/piddnad/DDColor/blob/master/MODEL_ZOO.md)

DDColor offers 4 models (`modelscope`, `artistic`, `paper` & `paper_tiny`), of which I used 3.

I ran them using [chaiNNer](https://github.com/chaiNNer-org/chaiNNer) and I was quite pleased with the **Modelscope** results.
